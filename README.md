This code is made for stress testing any blockchain sharing Bitcoin codebase.
In the instance shown it is using Globalboost since it is rather inexpensive
at the moment.

The only limits I have found is not haveing enought unspent UTXO inputs.
I suggest sending alot of small transactions to the wallet you are to use.

You can adjust several variables, time intervals, amount to send at once, 
wallet addresses etc.

This code is compiled in Freebasic. Freebasic compiler is available 
here https://www.freebasic.net/ and is  made for many archetectures.

                                                     
TODO: The initial posted version is for Linux, most likely will add 
a windoze version. Also may spice it up in the future, add random
numbers and timeouts to make the traffic look more natural.
